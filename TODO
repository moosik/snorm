1. Fix variablesRelation.R function: more intelligent table result: no repeated
test pairs, fewer significant digits. May want to separate the results (will be easier
to sort when the results are saved as an Excel table.


2. Write tests


3. Do additional code clean up with formatR and lintr


6.Write a vignette for the package demonstrating the use of the functions. Use
either a simulated dataset or a small real data.

7. pcScatter: what if the variable name is not present in the metadata, add
a check for that.

8. Functions such as pcScatter that want the name of the variable, make sure
that there is an approproate behaviour for the cases when the metadata doesn't
have column names, add an intelligent message

9. Intelligent message if u$v doesn't have row names

10. Add a function for the row distribution of the data colored by the row variables
